J_Ops are a few Nuke plug-ins and python scripts which I’ve found handy and figured others might as well. More information on them (outside of this manual), and on what’s in the pipeline can be got from the development blog <a class="FlexURL" href="http://major-kong.blogspot.com">http://major-kong.blogspot.com</a>. Any comments you may have, best off communicating via the Nuke-Users list, or to jackbinks at googlemail.com.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Disclaimer: Although I work at the Foundry, I’m not a developer by trade, and this is something I’ve done entirely outside of work - so don’t go to them with any issues you find! In addition, if one of the Foundry devs did this, I’m sure they’d do a much better job! By downloading and using the J_Ops bundle you are accepting responsbility for any issues that may arise from their use or presence.
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-1.1">1.1</a> Installation
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Grab the binary package for your platform and version of Nuke off the dev blog. Note that NDK plug-ins are very version specific; if you get the wrong version all bets are off. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Once you’ve downloaded the resultant archive, decompress it by double clicking to extract the underlying installer (executable on windows and linux, pkg on OSX). Double clicking that will fire up a standard installer which’ll place the files included into the standard NDK plug-in locations, as introduced in Nuke6.1.

Note that earlier versions installed into your .nuke directory (as Nuke 6.0 and before did not have the concept of a standard centralised NDK plug-in location). To ensure later versions get picked up it’s best to go into your .nuke directory and manually remove the previous version.

</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
If you install to the default directory then the related version of Nuke you launch will find the plug-ins on start up. If you choose a custom location in the installers, or if you use the manual install process in the OSX and linux bundles, you will need to ensure that Nuke is able to pick up the plug-ins from that location. To do this you need to set the NUKE_PATH environment variable appropriately. See the Nuke manual for more information on how to do this.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Once you’re successful you should see a new ’J_Ops’ entry on the Nuke toolbar.

Now it follows the more restricted and Nukepedia friendly &lt;Major&gt;.&lt;Minor&gt;, with a v number in use in builds themselves.

J_3Way is an NDK plug-in offering quick, artist friendly grading via an on screen control system, grade interchange via the ASC CDL format, and an extensible python framework for writing extra I/O modules. 
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-2.1.2">2.1.2</a> Usage
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
The J_3Way control system was designed to give you direct control over the grade whilst remaining in the viewer. This association of control with the image canvas allows you to see the context of every decision without having to refer back and forth between control panel and viewer.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
There are three main control system interaction methods: 
</div>
<ol>

<li>
Via the virtual colour wheel interface, present in every area of the viewer except the actual colour wheel. 
</li>
<li>
Via the actual colour wheel interface in the viewer. 
</li>
<li>
Via conventional Nuke control panel interaction
</li>
</ol>
<div class="Paragraph">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-1"></a>The Virtual Colour Wheel Interface 
</div>
<div class="Unindented">
The recommended way of setting up a grade is via 1. the virtual colour wheel interface, which can be thought of as a kind of ’poor man’s control surface’, if you will. To use this, click over any part of the screen other than the colour wheel. At this point you can enter one of three modes - lift, gain or gamma - by pressing z, x or c respectively. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
When in a mode any cursor movement will be interpreted as a movement on a virtual colour wheel, with origin at the cursor position from which you entered the mode. Indeed, you can check out how the resultant move looks on the actual colour wheel interface present in the lower left of the viewer window. Releasing the current mode key again will toggle you out of that mode, and pressing a different mode key will toggle you out of the current mode and into the new mode associated with that key. Depressing multiple mode keys will keep you in the current mode, and add you into the new mode as well. At this point any movement will be translated as a move on both the mode’s colour wheels. This swift method of mode shifting allows you to rapidly bounce between the lift, gain and gamma parameters, tweaking each so as to balance other and obtain the desired grade.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
When in any mode, a number of modifier keys can be held down so as to alter the impact of the current move, namely: 
</div>
<div class="Description">
<span class="Description-entry">Shift </span>- to gear up the change caused by the mouse movement, ie making a mouse move have a greater impact on the colour change 
</div>
<div class="Description">
<span class="Description-entry">Ctrl/Cmd </span>- to gear down the change caused by the mouse movement, ie making a mouse move have a lesser impact on the colour change 
</div>
<div class="Description">
<span class="Description-entry">Ctrl/Cmd+Shift </span>- to temporarily ignore all mouse moves. Useful when you’re getting close to the edge of the Viewer and want to continue adjusting the colour. 
</div>
<div class="Description">
<span class="Description-entry">Alt </span>- to interpret the mouse move as a luminance shift, rather than a hue/saturation colour wheel shift. Vertical moves are taken into account.
</div>
<div class="Unindented">
For you keyboard junkies, when in a particular mode you can also use the standard Nuke nudge keys (ie the numpad), coupled with the above modifiers, in place of the mouse to cause colour adjustments.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
I’d thoroughly recommend a trackball when working with J_3Way and the virtual colour wheel interface, it just feels better!
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Note, due to the overlay capturing all input mouse action when the J_3Way control panel is open, there is shift compared to general Nuke plug-in overlays in that the virtual colour wheel will only capture mouse input when the J_3Way control panel is currently selected. This means if you have multiple control panels open you can still interact with the other panel’s in viewer controls by deselecting J_3Way. To return selection, either click on the control panel, or click on the actual colour wheel drawn in the Viewer.
</div>
<div class="Paragraph">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-2"></a>The Actual Colour Wheel Interface 
</div>
<div class="Unindented">
As you’ve probably noticed, you can also pick up the handles in the hue/saturation colour wheel and the luminance slider present in the Viewer when the J_3Way control panel is open. This allows direct interaction, and the ability to set a handle to a particular colour. The handles are identified by the mode hotkey printed next to them, and highlighted in the selected colour specified in the settings when selected via a mode hotkey.
</div>
<div class="Paragraph">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-3"></a>GPU Engine
</div>
<div class="Unindented">
J_3Way implements a gpu engine inside of the Nuke glslang framework, meaning if you can satisfy the caveats following you can set up Nuke so that J_3Way gives you lightning fast feedback. 
</div>
<ul>

<li>
You need a meaty enough gfx card in your machine. If you see an error message in the terminal regarding your graphics card not supporting float or half float it means you probably don’t.
</li>
<li>
J_3Way needs to be the last thing in the tree, ie, hook it up directly to the Viewer. Anything inbetween J_3Way and the viewer will break the gpu concatenation inside of Nuke, and the gpu engine will not be called. 
</li>
<li>
You need an early adopters mindset :) . This is a very new part of Nuke (read: quite shonky) and you’ll intermittently get things like the Viewer not updating when it should. If this happens kill the viewer and open a new one. 
</li>
</ul>
<div class="Unindented">
To use the gpu engine, hook up J_3Way to the viewer as described, open the viewer settings and switch bit depth to half-float, and toggle on ’use GPU for viewer...’ and ’use GPU for inputs...’.
</div>
<div class="Paragraph">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-4"></a>Using J_3Way as part of Viewer Lookups
</div>
<div class="Unindented">
If you’ve been communicated a look/grade via a cdl file you may wish to employ J_3Way in some form of viewer lookup configuration. Check out the Nuke manual regarding VIEWER_INPUT and ViewerProcess handling for more information on the standard Nuke methods to do this.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-2.1.3">2.1.3</a> ASC CDL File I/O Framework
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
J_3Way implements an extensible python framework, allowing for import and export of ASC CDL files. Currently it supports CDL and CCC XML file import, and thanks to the framework you can extend this to any file type which you can parse via python. Obviously it’s taken a bit of effort to implement this in such a manner, rather than simply hiding it underneath the hood, so what I do ask is if you do add support for new file types and are able to share it, then drop the amended/new python files in an email on the Nuke-Users list. It’ll give you a warm fuzzy feeling of contributing back, and I’ll of course credit to you in the documentation. Also, feel free to clean up my frankly shocking python code and drop that back :)
</div>
<div class="Indented">
To import a CCC or a CDL file, simply go to the CDL tab, select the filename in the file knob, then hit ’Import’. Note this’ll overwrite your current J_3Way settings, but if you decide the import was a bad idea, a judicious undo will get you back to pretty much where you started. Note that the ASC CDL does not define a source colour space explicitly, so you’ll need to check the description field for if the grade conveyed should be applied to the footage in question in Nuke’s linear space, or some other colourspace. Often toggling on raw/switching to linear on the source read will get you the result expected.
</div>
<div class="Paragraph">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-5"></a>Implementing your own CDL Import/Export
</div>
<div class="Unindented">
The python framework for J_3Way is all contained within the /J_Ops/py/J_Ops/J_3Way/ directory, situated wherever you chose to install the plug-ins. The following is a breakdown of what the existing files do:
</div>
<div class="List">
<span class="List-entry">J_3Way.py</span>contains the main entry functions from the plug-in. J_3Way will call either importCDL() or exportCDL() within here in response to an appropriate button push on it’s control panel.
</div>
<div class="List">
<span class="List-entry">parseCCC.py</span>implements the simple colour correction import XML parser. It’s a good starting point to look at if you want to write your own I/O module.
</div>
<div class="List">
<span class="List-entry">parseCDL.py</span>implements the somewhat more complex colour deicision list XML parser. This makes use of the CCC parser when it hits a ColourCorrectionRef entry, which if you’re looking to implement EDL/ALE/FLEX parsing is probably something you’ll hit

The following is the basic order of events:
</div>
<ol>

<li>
J_3Way calls importCDL() or exportCDL() in J_3Way.py in response to a button push by the user. It grabs the extension and picks a parsing module based on that. 
</li>
<li>
J_3Way.py creates an instance of the parser (from parseXXX.py), calling the parse() main entry function, passing it the filename entered.
</li>
<li>
parseXXX.py grabs the set of colour correction identifiers out of the file and stores them in a local dictionary called ’colourcorrectionvalues’
</li>
<li>
parseXXX.py creates an instance of the parseDialogue in CDLUtils. The dialogue grabs the list of identifiers from the parser and displays as an enumerated list
</li>
<li>
The parseDialogue calls the parseXXX.py’s parseElement method, passing the currently selected ColorCorrection identifier. The parser then goes back to the file and figures out the description and colour correction settings related to that identifier. It pops these in the colourcorrectionvalues dict also, and returns to the parseDialogue which grabs the values and displays them.
</li>
<li>
The dialogue awaits input. On an identifier change it calls the parser again, as in step 5. On an ’ok’ or ’cancel’ click it returns to the parser, which, if necessary, sets the target knob values.
</li>
</ol>

There’s a few more shennanigans involved to get the CCC by ref id, and corresponding knobs working, which can be checked out in more depth in the code itself. So, to create your own module you’ll need to:
</div>
<ol>

<li>
Create a new python module, named in line with the others and add to the relevant imports.
</li>
<li>
Edit J_3Way.py to cause your module to be called by the appropriate file extension is found.

<li>
Implement the parse, parseID and parseElement functions.
</li>
<li>
Fiddle around with it til it works.

<ul>

<li class="nested">

<div class="Description">
<span class="Description-entry">channels </span>- Channel selector, inherited from NukeWrapper. Allows you to pick which channel the grade is applied to. Note that the gpu engine does not support this, and will always apply its grade to the base RGB channel, so if you’re working on a non base layer you’ll need to switch off the gpu processing path in your viewer settings.
</div>
<div class="Description">
<span class="Description-entry">Mapping </span>- Drop down list which specifies how the lift, gamma and gain knobs are translated to the ASC CDL values used by the underlying transfer function. The ’Lift/Gamma/Gain’ option uses the DI standard mapping found on most grading systems, the ’ASC direct’ option maps directly (so lift=offset, gain=slope, and gamma=1/power), so offering more ’compositor’ style interaction.
</div>
<div class="Description">
<span class="Description-entry">Clamp </span>- Bool knob (checkbox) governs whether the underlying algorithm performs the clamps specified by the ASC CDL specification. Their transfer functions include clamps which limit pixel values to the 0.0 to 1.0 range after both the SOP (Slope, Offset, Power) and the Sat operations. This toggle allows you to switch off these clamps so as not the clamp the pixel data. Bear in mind, with this switched off the result is not CDL compliant!
</div>
<div class="Description">
<span class="Description-entry">Lift/Gamma/Gain </span>- Colour knobs to specify your grade. They are translated to ASC CDL values as listed on the CDL tab, which are then used to calculate the resultant image via the CDL specified transfer functions. There are three main ways of altering the values of these: -Using Nuke standard &lt;childish snigger&gt; knob manipulation &lt;/childish snigger&gt; actions, such as typing directly into the value box, dragging sliders, alt+numerical drag and cursor keys. -Using the on screen colour wheel. When the J_3Way control panel is open all three values are depicted in the viewer colour wheel and luminance slider overlay. They are identified by the letters associated with them on the parameter panel (ie lift=z, gain=x, gamma=c), and can be picked up and dropped at will. -Using the on screen interaction tools, which is the recommended way of altering the parameters. Once the viewer has focus (ie click on it) you can then toggle into lift, gain or gamma mode by pressing the associated mode hotkey. For example, press z to toggle into lift mode, at which point any mouse move will be interpreted as a movement on a virtual colour wheel (ie Hue and Saturation change), updating the image, and the colourwheel overlay, as you go to show you the result of the current colour grade. Pressing z again will toggle you out of lift mode. Alternatively, you can press x to switch to gain, or shift+z to add gain to the current virtual colour wheel, so as to alter lift and gain simultaneously. Whilst in a particular mode you can use the following modifiers to alter the action of the mouse move: -Shift - gear up speed of move -Ctrl (win/linux)/Cmd (OSX) - gear down speed of move -Ctrl/Cmd + Shift - any mouse move should not be translated to a parameter change. Use to temporarily move the cursor around the screen without altering the params. -Alt - interpret vertical move as a luminance change Instead of using the mouse, you can also use the keyboard nudge keys (ie numpad) to alter the current mode in a particular direction, again using shift and ctrl/cmd keys to gear up and down.

J_GeoManager is a 3D utility tool providing both information on the fed in 3D scene and enabling stripping of objects and/or attributes from the stream, from the point of view of troubleshooting badly rendering or heavy scenes. For example, in the circumstance where you’re reading in all objects in an fbx (to get the full transform tree), but don’t actually need most of them, J_GeoManager will allow you to strip out those you don’t want fed further downstream. Info provided includes point and vertex counts, presence of materials, transforms and attributes including, but not limited to, the various object’s normals and UVs.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-2.2.2">2.2.2</a> Usage
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Basic usage involves adding the node after the 3d nodes for which you wish to see the resultant info from and/or strip data. Ensure the viewer is hooked up downstream to pull data through the node, which’ll in turn populate the main table knob <b>geolist</b>. 
</div>
<div class="Paragraph">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-6"></a>Nuke Objects &amp; Attributes
</div>
<div class="Unindented">
The geolist knob is the heart of the GeoManager plug-in, displaying data on both the incoming scene and on the settings made to alter it, where each row equates to an object in the scene. In Nuke, an object will have a variety of semi static data associated with it (it’s point and vertex data, whether it has a material or a transformation matrix associated and so on), as well as an arbitrary array of ’attribute’ data. Attributes are associated with one of the object’s semi static data groups (ie the attributes can be attributable to the point data, the transformation matrix, etc), and have a name label. So, for example, the UV data on an object can be present on the points or the vertices, dependant on the level of complexity required. J_GeoManager shows the 5 standard Nuke attributes (N - normals, UV - uv texture, Cf - colour, PW - world position, and vel for velocity) and each one can be attributable to up to 5 of the groups (namely 25 different combinations). The <b>geolist</b> table contain columns for everything from object IDs, point and vertex data counts, through the range of attributes to the presence of materials and transformation data.

</div>
<div class="Unindented">
Using the checkbox toggles in the <b>En</b> column of the <b>geoinfo</b> table knob it is possible to selectively remove objects, however more detailed or selective changes require use of the ’per row’ knobs found under the table. These are selectively enabled and disabled depending on the current row selection in the <b>geoinfo</b> table. For example, to disable multiple objects simultaneously, select their respective rows in the table and then toggle off the <b>Enable (En)</b> knob in the per row knobs (see below info on how to select these by selecting their in viewer representations). Similarly, if you want to zero out a particular attribute (an attribute in Nuke town being a piece of arbitrary data associated with one of the either the object’s points, vertices, etc - for example an object’s UVs), you’d select the object’s row in the table, go down to the per row knobs and toggle off the respective checkbox in the attribute table. If you cock something up you can easily reset one or more rows by selecting them and using the <b>Reset</b> button.

<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-8"></a>Baking Transform Data

<div class="Unindented">
For the majority of the scene data that can be affected (objects, attributes, materials, etc) the options are either to allow it through (ie Passthrough, or P) or to strip it (ie Zero, or 0). If an item is not present in the incoming stream it’ll be signified either with None present or a blank space. For transform data you can additionally elect to Bake, or B, the matrix. By default a transform associated with an object will be carried as an extra local-to-world transform matrix alongside the point data - by baking this data you’re able to set this extra matrix to identity and pre-emptively apply it’s previous transform data onto the mesh points themselves. This can be handy in those circumstances where the matrix data isn’t being accounted for, for whatever reason.

J_GotSomeID is a utility tool allowing fast and easy extraction of mattes and premulted channelsets from ID/Object passes from 3D, taking into account a range of encodings of ID and coverage/aliasing data.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-2.3.2">2.3.2</a> Usage
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
To get started, hook up the node to your 3d import and in the <b>ID</b> channelset knob select the incoming ID/Object pass. Pick its encoding in the <b>Type</b> drop down, then optionally pick the coverage channel in the <b>Coverage</b> drop down. At this point you can start either picking a few objects manually, or use the <b>Autofill</b> button to create output passes for each and every object in the incoming stream and frame range. Note that if you have a lot of IDs and you only want to grab one or two the latter unlikely to be wise, since it’ll create a lot of unrequired channelsets and take some time. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
To manually pick which objects you want channels for hook up a viewer ensure the picker is selected and <b>mode</b> is set to add, then cmd/ctrl click on the objects in the scene you want output passes for. The picker will grab the ID from the selected ID channelset automatically (regardless of what channel the viewer is set to) and create an entry in the <b>idlist</b> with the selected ID, an autogenerated channelset name, and checkbox defaults taken from the default knobs at the panel footer.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
If you picked the wrong object select the entry, flip the mode to edit and cmd/ctrl click on the viewer again, thus altering its ID values in the <b>idlist</b>. You can also alter the <b>idlist</b> values, such as the channelset name, manually by double clicking and typing directly. To alter multiple output passes checkbox values, select the items on the list and toggle the checkboxes at the panel footer. To find a certain entry based on an object, flip the <b>mode</b> to find and cmd/ctrl click on the object in the viewer. If a matching output pass is found it’ll be sleected in the <b>idlist</b>. Finally, to add or delete entries use the + and - buttons at the bottom of the <b>idlist.</b>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Coverage passes allow aliasing data to be passed to the compositor. The most prevalent technique is to encode aliasing data into a separate output channel called the coverage pass. This can be used in J_GotSomeID by setting <b>type</b> to a Cov type, then checking the Cov checkbox on the required output pass. Where object aliasing crosses others this may look slightly wrong since aliasing data from one object is crossing another. Enabling <b>Dil</b> for an output pass attempts to fix this by dilating a fringe from the current object, flipping the aliasing data found and using this as additional falloff aliasing for the current object. Occasionally you may also see an ID pass where the ID are stashed around the Hue/Saturation wheel. More occasionally in these circumstances you may find that the aliasing data has been stashed in the ID pass V data, as opposed to separate pass. Both of these circumstances can be handled by selecting the appropriate entry from the <b>type</b> drop down. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Nuke’s channel system does not allow channelsets to be removed from the current session, thus if you add a lot of channels and remove them, or alternative rename channelsets a lot you’ll find the channel lists become populated with a lot of now defunct channelsets. Those not used in the current channel are removed when killing the current session and reloading the script. Additionally, channelset names should be alphanumeric.

<li>
Aligning the source images.

</div>
<div class="Paragraph">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-9"></a>Source &amp; Target Exposures
</div>
<div class="Unindented">
Once you’ve hooked up the node to the various LDR images, you need to tell J_MergeHDR what the rough exposure data for the source streams is. For any modern camera this should be present in the metadata read in, so the first order of the day is to hit the ’Get Source Metadata’ button. This’ll query the source stream’s metadata looking for the keys set in the ’Metadata’ tab’s search strings. In most circumstances the defaults should be fine and you’ll now see that the source exposure parameters have been filled in. If the search has been unsuccessful the op with error and will tell you on which inputs it was unable to find the metadata key strings specified. This could be down to either 
</div>
<div class="Description">
<span class="Description-entry">a) </span>the metadata string being wrong, in which case use a ViewMetadata node to see what the string should be, amend it and hit ’Get Source Metadata’ again.
</div>
<div class="Description">
<span class="Description-entry">b) </span>there being no metadata of the exposure data present in the source. In this circumstance you’ll have to enter the data manually into the source ’Exposure’ panel params. Note that shutter speed is expected in seconds (and you’re probably used to seeing it in 1/ notation). In this case simply go into the appropriate shutter speed knob and type in ’1/&lt;your value&gt;’ and hit enter for Nuke to evaluate for you. If you simply dont have the data at all you can dial in values manually by eye. In this case it’s generally easiest to switch on ’EV Input’ which allows you to dial in the EV knob directly (conventionally it’s contributed to by ISO, shutter and aperture separately, but since you don’t know that data, you might as well cut it right out of the loop).
</div>
<div class="Unindented">
The first thing you’ll probably notice, having filled in the source metadata, is that the output’s got very white. That’s because the target exposure default is set to unity, and in most normal circumstances your exposure values are going to be way in excess of that. To sort that out either manually tweak down, or hit the ’Set Target Metadata’ button. This’ll set the target exposure values to be the median of the input range, which is normally a pretty good starting point. You can now manually dial up or down the desired target using the ’Exp Adjust’ slider.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Occasionally this is all that is required to get an acceptable, and usable, result. 
</div>
<div class="Paragraph">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-10"></a>Alignment
</div>
<div class="Unindented">
Often you’ll get source images which aren’t perfectly registered. If you’re one of the lucky ones who’s images are already aligned then skip this stage, otherwise read on. The Alignment panel on the J_MergeHDR tab allows you to dial in offsets, in pixels, for each image in turn. Hitting ’Calculate Alignment’ will fire off a process which’ll attempt to figure out these offsets automatically. If the results aren’t perfect they’re normally better, and form a good basis to subsequently tweak.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
If the results are way out of whack there are a couple of params you can try tweaking on the ’Alignment’ tab. First up, ’Exclusion’ allows you to set the range of data around the image median value which is ignored when comparing sources too each other. A higher ignore range will have the effect of rejecting more noise, so if you have particularly noisy or grainy images you can try tweaking this up. Note that going too far means it less likely to find a registration, so your better bet is probably to run a noise reduction pass on the images first (note that the response estimation is also affected adversely by noise, so a reduction pass first is probably a good idea there as well). Max offset allows you to define the search range. Great ranges take longer, and are likely to be less robust. If you’re looking &gt;50 pixel mark then buy a tripod, or manually set the alignment offsets.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The alignment functionality only deals with translation offsets. If there are rotational differences between the frames then you’ll often find that fixing their translational offsets will have the effect of pushing the rotational disparity to the edge of the frame, where it’s not particularly noticeable. If it’s still getting to you, hook up a transform node on the afflicted input and fix it manually. Greg Ward’s papaer, mentioned before, is a good read if you’re looking to get more in depth with the alignment estimation functionality, in particular looking at the diagnostic views and what they mean.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
You’ll often find that if something goes wrong, it’ll be only on one or two inputs, and finding out which ones is tricky. On the ’Input’ panel on the ’J_MergeHDR’ tab you’ll find a series of ’enable’ checkboxes. These’ll allow you to selectively switch on and off which inputs are rendering (and having the alignment estimation run on them) and so find the offending culprits.
</div>
<div class="Paragraph">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-11"></a>Response
</div>
<div class="Unindented">
The final step, if necessary, is to estimate the response curve of the camera with which a scene was shot. Camera manufacturers (and models, and lenses, and chips, and ad infinitum) have their own ideas of what makes a perfect way to reproduce the range of data in the image down to a low dynamic range, where direct mapping of intensity data to resultant value is generally of rather low importance. If you’re lucky the work done thus far is enough to give a result which is sufficient for your needs, otherwise we’re going to have to look at figuring out a reverse of whatever mapping was applied. Now, by it’s very nature this is only ever an approximation. Often, parts of the ’special sauce’ camera manufacturers apply can be spatially localised dependent on surrounding luminance conditions, and a lookup mapping such as we’re trying to use to invert it can only get so far. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The curves tab contains 4 curves. 3 for the different colour channels of the logarithmic camera response, and 1 for the weighting curve applied both when estimating the response, and when recombining the exposures. Hitting ’Calculate Response’ will fire off the algorithm described in Debevec’s ’Radiance Maps’ paper as mentioned earlier, which’ll attempt to estimate these curves for us. The result will be used to render immediately, so you’ll get an idea of if it’s what you need. Bear in mind you’ll likely need to tonemap the data down, or apply something like J_Scopes, to get an idea of the resultant intensity distribution.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
There are two main means by which we can impact the results. The algorithm initially picks a series of samples from the source images (which is why it’s important they align), and then passes these sampled pixels values into the actual solve phase. To impact the feature selection, use the knobs in the ’Response’ tab’s ’Feature’s’ group. Check out where the features lie and if many sit on clipped, or noisy, image data try altering the seed or changing the total number to avoid these regions. To alter the solve use the ’Response’ tab’s ’Solve’ knobs. If you have an excessively spikey response try increasing lambda (and vica versa). If your response is too high on it’s upper limit, try increasing the unity point up (in the range 0 to 1), and vica versa.

J_Mullet is a suite of 5 plug-ins offering rigid body physics simulation inside of Nuke, based upon the Bullet engine. The J_MulletSolver is the core of the toolkit, performing the actual calculations, whilst the remainder allow you to define the properties of your scene by inserting metadata into a Nuke 3D stream. At minimum you need to add a J_MulletBody node to a geometry stream, followed up by a J_MulletSolver node. The Mullet toolkit is mainly aimed at quick and easy physics simulations in the context of compositing, as opposed to hero shot physics simulations. It is limited to working on a constant number of objects per scene, as well as working on objects with properties within an order of magnitude of each other.
</div>
<ul>

<li>
J_MulletSolver. The core engine tool of the Mullet toolkit, this performs the heavy lifting when it comes to calculating the scene interactions - every simulation needs one. It additionally allows for calculations to be baked down to matrix knobs, so that they need not be performed again and again.
</li>
<li>
J_MulletBody. Defines the presence of a piece of geometry within the physics scene, and allows you to specify a range of properties, including the shape with which it should be represented (its collision shape), the body’s weight, center of mass and more.
</li>
<li>
J_MulletCompound. Allows physics bodies to be built from multiple pieces of geometry. 
</li>
<li>
J_MulletConstraint. Allows physics bodies to be connected to each other via a variety of joints. Additionally, joints can be configured to break as a result of collisions and other force interactions. This should be used to build more complicated networks of geometry connections that break when hit by another object, or by a force within the scene. 
</li>
<li>
J_MulletForce. Allows forces to be added to the physics scene, and configured to act on all, or a subset of the objects within the physics scene.
</li>
</ul>
<div class="Unindented">
Standard usage generally consists of bringing in your scene geometry (prefractured where you want to explode or otherwise break items), setting up a scene using the solver calculating on the fly, then baking down the resultant simulation once you’re happy with it, or when it starts to get too slow to work with. All the Mullet nodes are extensively tooltipped, so the following per node sections are more of an introduction - see the knob tooltips for more extensive discussions of the options available.

J_MulletBody is part of the Mullet toolset which offers rigid body dynamics simulation within Nuke’s 3D scene. J_MulletBody inserts metadata into the stream conveying an object’s desired characteristics. To have any affect it needs to be followed with a J_MulletSolver node which will actually does the heavy lifting of simulating the scene together. Each incoming object selected can either be individually set to be a physics world body, or they can be grouped together to become a single compound body which interacts together as a group.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
A body in the physics world is represented by a set of characteristics roughly approximated to real world physical properties (such as mass and friction) along with a collision shape. Generally the collision shape is a simplified version of the actual object, allowing faster simulation of interactions. 
</div>
<div class="Paragraph">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-12"></a>Body Characteristics
</div>
<div class="Unindented">
The first tab allows you to select a range of incoming objects and define whether each or all represent a single body and whether than body is a <b>dynamic</b>, <b>kinematic</b>, or <b>static</b>. For ease of script reading the current body type is automatically shown on the node’s label. A dynamic body is subject to all applied forces, constraints and interactions, whilst kinematics and statics are simply part of the scene with which dynamic objects can collide. Kinematic bodies will update their position to match the source, whilst statics are stuck at their initial position at the simulation start frame.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Additional characteristics include the body’s mass, centre of mass, friction, damping and bounciness.
</div>
<div class="Paragraph">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-13"></a>Collision Shape
</div>
<div class="Unindented">
The second tab governs the body’s collision shape. An object can be modelled as a <b>sphere</b>, <b>cube</b> or<b> convex hull</b>, where complexity of shape is traded off against speed of simulation. Again, for ease of script reading the selected type is shown on the node’s label by default. J_MulletBody defaults to convex hull, for ease of setup, however if you can mimix your object by one of the simpler options you should. Convex hulls can also (and are by default) be automatically decimated for speed. Spheres and cubes use the bounding box to define their sizing, however this can be overridden.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
A collision shape additionally defines a <b>Margin</b>, defining when it starts to collide with surrounding objects. Often to get a good looking interaction between objects you need to override and tweak this for both objects involved with the collision.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
If you are seeing odd interactions between objects it is possible that your collision shape is not closely enough mimicking your object. Try switching on J_MulletSolver’s troubleshooting overlay, looking at the wireframes in particular to see how closely they match the actual object.

J_MulletSolver is the engine tool of the Mullet toolkit, allowing rigid body dynamics simulation within Nuke’s 3D engine. The remaining tools in the suite simply insert metadata into the stream which is utilised by the solver to govern how the object interaction takes place. No J_MulletSolver in your scene means no simulation will take place, as does no metadata inserting tool, such as J_MulletBody, since the solver will not know that a dynamic body exists.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
A scene can contain dynamic, kinematic and static rigid bodies, which can be connected together (or to absolute positions in the scene) via systems of constraints, and acted on by forces. Bodies can be arranged into compounds, which enable them to behave as a single entity.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The Mullet toolkit is mainly aimed at quick and easy physics simulations in the context of compositing, as opposed to hero shot physics simulations. It is also limited to working on a constant number of objects per scene. Introducing or removing objects during the simulation range will result in undefined behaviour; don’t do it. If you need to allow an object to interact only after a certain range of time there are a number of options, including suspending it out of shot on a kinematic body which is moved out the way, on a breakable constraint which is broken using a suitably sized force, or applying an invisible texture up to a certain frame.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The Mullet toolkit uses the Bullet physics simulation library underneath the hood, which establishes a number of limitations on the type of scene that it can model. The simulation engine is designed to simulate interactions between bodies of size and mass within an order of magnitude of each other. As such it will not provide a realistic representation, for example, of a tiny, light, fast moving body (for example a bullet) hitting a slow, heavy, large object (such as a tank)

<div class="Unindented">
Nuke uses hashes to track the ’fingerprint’ of the current node graph, and so to figure out when knobs/reads/etc change and a rerender is required. For 2D there’s a single hash, but for 3D there are a range, depending on which part of the 3D structure (point positions, object positions, UVs, etc) need to change. Unfortunately some of these 3D hashes, depending on the ops in use, are not the most stable and may change from one script load to the next. J_MulletSolver identifies whether the current <b>Bake</b> cache is valid using combinations of these hashes as an <b>ID</b>. If the solver simply used the relevant hashes you’d unfortunately find that, thanks to the lack of robust hash consistency, it would randomly start reporting the <b>Bake</b> cache as invalid from one script load to the next. Instead, the <b>Bake ID Strategy</b> group offers control over how various parts of the incoming scene and settings are combined.

J_rawReader is a rewrite of the NDK example crwReader which supports the reading of a variety of SLR raw camera formats. Whilst the crwReader utilises the third party DCRaw command line application thus requiring additional tools to be installed, J_rawReader uses the rather awesome LibRaw to do the heavy lifting, making it faster and more robust than the crwReader. Additionally, J_rawReader implements a flexible RAM and disk caching system to speed up your workflow, along with a progress feedback system to keep you up to date with what its doing. Additionally it injects metadata from the raw file into the stream, allows extensive control over the underlying raw negative development process, and adds redirects (ie support) for Nikon and Panasonic raw formats plus Adobe DNG, in addition to the already present Canon support.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-2.11.2">2.11.2</a> Usage
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
First off, note that a link to create a ’J_rawReader’ doesn’t appear in the J_Ops toolbar; as with any other filereader in Nuke it is created by adding a read node and attempting to read a file of the type supported by the reader. Currently files of the types ’crw’ ’cr2’ ’dng’ ’nrw’ ’nef’ and ’rw2’ will cause a J_rawReader to be used. If there is another file type which you know can be read by DCRaw, and which you want to use, then drop a request onto the nuke users list asking me to add a redirect.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Debayering is a slow process, however J_rawReader’s RAM and disk caching system should ensure that it only happens when required. When you see a progress bar appear it’s likely that it’s having to go through this process. Note that the disk caching mechanism is fairly disk hungry, so the larger you’re able to set your cache preferences, the better it’ll perform.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The disk cache may occasionally get confused (particularly when the cache is shared between platforms). You may see errors pop up about not being able to read or write the cache. In this circumstance, use the Render-&gt;Clear Disk Cache function, followed by a reload on the Read node itself.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
J_rawReader will attempt to read metadata from the input file and insert it into the metadata in the stream. It’ll use the exif namespace for data which maps to an exif counterpart (currently limited to the exposure data used by J_MergeHDR), and a raw namespace for all remaining data it is able to extract. Append a viewmetadata to see the resultant data.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
J_rawReader exposes a range of knobs to allow you to tune to underlying raw negative development process to your needs, even to the extent of setting up proxy decode parameters separately to full res. LibRaw is based on DCRaw, so if you’re familiar with the DCRaw flags you’ll find they largely have direct mappings to the LibRaw controls exposed. The development controls are divided into three main groups - quality, colour (inc white balance, histogram based corrections and manual corrections) and artefact correction. The knobs are described in more depth in the following section. For more information on DCRaw, the tool upon which LibRaw is based, and the flags available see the DCRaw homepage available at <a class="FlexURL" href="http://www.cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/.">http://www.cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/.</a>

Some depth encodings normalise the underlying depth data, thus losing the absolute depth values. In the circumstance that you pick such an encoding the tool will enable additional Clip Near and Clip Far knobs, allowing the resultant conversion to be scaled to take into account the normalisation. Depending on how you limited the range in your 3D package, either enter the clips from the source camera, or use the range limits imposed in your render pass configuration. If you don’t care about the absolute values (or wish to scale the data manually using other Nuke tools) then opt for the defaults. If you select an normalised encoding for the target then the two clamp checkboxes will enable, allowing you to force clamp the resultant depth map to the notional range imposed.

J_ZKeyer is a utility tool allowing easy extraction of mattes and depth of field representations from a z-depth pass, via a number of different interfaces, but primarily a quick and intuitive eyedropper based system. The node is additionally able to setup other depth related nodes (such as ZBlur) with matching configuration, once a region has been selected.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-2.14.2">2.14.2</a> Usage
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Hook up a J_ZKeyer node to an image stream with a z-depth pass, switching the node’s <b>Depth </b>knob to the appropriate channel if the pass doesn’t reside in the usual depth.z. Now use the <b>mode</b> drop down to elect whether you wish to pick the region from the central focal plane and one of it’s extremes (<b>Focal Plane/Region)</b>, pick the front and back specifically (<b>DOF Near/Far)</b>, or pick the focal plane and use a real world camera approximation to define the depth region (<b>Focal Plane/Real World). </b>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
If you picked either <b>Focal Plane/Region </b>or <b>DOF Near/Far </b>you’ll now get a pick mode drop down from which you can specify which of the two you’ll be colour picking, and then use standard viewer sampling hotkeys to grab samples from the desired area. For example, if you’re looking to setup a ZBlur to throw out of focus the background, but leave the foreground, you’d pick the <b>Focal Plane </b>by sampling the foreground object, and the <b>Region</b> by sampling from some object just behind the foreground. Note that the sample will always be taken from the elected depth channel, regardless of what channel the viewer is configured to use, so you’re easily able to sample from the actual scene beauty pass itself.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Once you’ve sampled as required you’ll notice that the <b>Output</b> section knobs are now filled in with the data, and you can now either use the provided buttons to create an appropriate setup ZBlur node (or Peregrine Lab’s Bokeh if you have this installed). Additionally you’re able to flip over to the <b>Matte</b> tab and use the controls there to generate a matte based on the region elected. Note that sane people don’t anti alias their depth passes, so of course the same aliasing will be present in mattes generated from it. By default the matte will be binary - 0 for pixels not in the region, and 1 for those that are. You can elect to use the profile curves option so as to provide a roll off to the edges, and there’s a number of such curves available as predefined buttons below the curve knob itself.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The <b>Real World </b>section knobs, enabled when the mode is set to <b>Focal Plane/Real World</b>, allows a region depth to be approximated using idealised real world camera parameters - namely the focal length and aperture. Additionally the circle of confusion for this idealised imaging system can be altered, but it’s generally best left on default unless you know what you’re doing. This requires the depth pass to be encoded as Distance; use J_ZMaths if required to convert if necessary.

The improved drag and drop script builds on Nuke’s bundled drop functionality to add creation of ReadGeo, Camera, Light and Vectorfield nodes when geometry or LUT files are dropped on them as appropriate. In the circumstance that a folder is dropped on the DAG then a per sequence node is created, and optionally (controlled in the J_Ops preferences) the script will recurse into sub directories creating nodes for each sequence found therein.

Each script can store up to 9 positions, and a bookmark can either use the previously clicked location (Store Bookmark) or the average location of all the selected nodes (Store Node Bookmark) as its point of origin. Bookmarks can be saved and restored using the menu entries created under Node toolbar-&gt;J_Ops-&gt;Python-&gt;DAG Bookmarks (if you don’t see this then the functionality is disabled in your preferences), using the TAB selector (each entry has a short initial form to make tab usage quick and simple) or via the hotkeys listed on the menu.

</div>
<ul>

<li>
J_Mullet added. J_Mullet is a suite of 5 plug-ins offering rigid body physics simulation inside of Nuke, based upon the Bullet engine. The J_MulletSolver is the core of the toolkit, performing the actual calculations, whilst the remainder allow you to define the properties of your scene by inserting metadata into a Nuke 3D stream. At minimum you need to add a J_MulletBody node to a geometry stream, followed up by a J_MulletSolver node. The Mullet toolkit is mainly aimed at quick and easy physics simulations in the context of compositing, as opposed to hero shot physics simulations. It is limited to working on a constant number of objects per scene, as well as working on objects with properties within an order of magnitude of each other.
<ul>

<li>
J_MulletSolver added. The core engine tool of the Mullet toolkit, this performs the heavy lifting when it comes to calculating the scene interactions - every simulation needs one. It additionally allows for calculations to be baked down to matrix knobs, so that they need not be performed again and again.
</li>
<li>
J_MulletBody added. Defines the presence of a piece of geometry within the physics scene, and allows you to specify a range of properties, including the shape with which it should be represented (its collision shape), the body’s weight, center of mass and more.
</li>
<li>
J_MulletCompound added. Allows physics bodies to be built from multiple pieces of geometry.
</li>
<li>
J_MulletConstraint added. Allows physics bodies to be connected to each other via a variety of joints. Additionally, joints can be configured to break as a result of collisions and other force interactions.
</li>
<li>
J_MulletForce added. Allows forces to be added to the physics scene, and configured to act on all, or a subset of the objects within the physics scene.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Added improved drag and drop python script, meaning that when geometry and LUT files are dropped on the DAG the ReadGeo, Light, Camera and/or Vectorfield node appropriate to their use is created (rather than the Read node created previously). Additionally the script can be configured to recurse into sub directories when folders are dropped. This functionality can be enabled and disabled in the J_Ops preferences tab.
</li>
<li>
Added DAG bookmarking python script, allowing node graph positions to be saved and recalled via the menu entries, the TAB selector or their associated hotkeys. This functionality can be enabled and disabled in the J_Ops preferences tab.
</li>
<li>
Added J_Ops preferences tab to main Nuke preferences, to allow control of J_Ops python script configuration.
</li>
<li>
J_rawReader: updated libraw for optimisations and bug fixes as well as to add support for newer cameras, including the Canon 5D mk3. Additionally added experimental support for ARRIRAW. This’ll updoubtedly be done better by the Foundry at some point, but it may get you out of a pickle in the meantime. Note that the colour handling for arri is all rather strange.
</li>
<li>
J_rawReader: exposed control over output colourspace from the process (equivalent to output_color in libRaw and the DCRaw -o flag). This chains with NUKE’s read colourspace, so the two need to be set in tandem.
</li>
<li>
J_rawReader: changed defaults for full res to use linear interpolation on the debayer, based on user feedback that linear is more than sufficient most of the time, making the extra compute time spent in AHD interpolation unnecessary.
</li>
<li>
J_rawReader: fixed crash when executing in terminal mode with disk caching switched on.
</li>
<li>
J_rawReader: fixed circumstance where bit depth may not be read correctly out of disk cache.
</li>
<li>
J_rawReader: fixed file handle leak that could cause session to become unstable when using long sequences or large numbers of raw files.
</li>
<li>
J_MergeHDR: allow animation of alignment knobs, so that hdr sequences can be merged with their alignment offsets animated.
</li>
<li>
J_MergeHDR: added a number of weight curve presets as buttons. Some users have been seeing banding in the extreme highlights and lowlights of merges. Different weighting curves often mitigate or eliminate these.
</li>
<li>
J_MergeHDR: changed weight curve default, again to mitigate banding some users have seen.
</li>
<li>
J_MergeHDR: fixed preview overlay intermittently not working due to Nuke 6.2 changes.
</li>
<li>
J_MergeHDR: fixed metadata get and reset buttons not working in terminal mode (these can now be called by their python execute methods, to allow scripting of HDR merge setups).
</li>
<li>
J_3Way: the Nuke guys recently added button release events (thanks guys!), which means that the colour corrector mode can now be set on a button depress, and unset on button release. This is how I always wanted the corrector to work, so have changed the defaults to do so. The old modal operation is still available by toggling the <b>Release</b> knob in the <b>Interface</b> group of the <b>Settings</b> tab.
</li>
<li>
Added manual install folder to linux install bundle at user request.
</li>
<li>
Shifted versioning to more nukepedia friendly shortened form.

<li>
Centos4.5 32bit platform dropped, inline with Nuke’s supported platforms.
</li>
<li>
J_rawReader: rewritten to use the rather awesome LibRaw, under CDDL license. New version has:
<ul>

<li>
No external dependancy on DCRaw, so nothing extra to install or configure.
</li>
<li>
Significantly improved performance, thanks to LibRaw and new internal RAM and disk caching mechanism.
</li>
<li>
Additional decode features present in LibRaw not available in DCRaw (at time of inclusion for example, DCB debayer interpolation and FBDD pre-debayer denoising)
</li>
<li>
Progress feedback.
</li>
<li>
Improved interface, presenting underlying options as series of knobs, as opposed to the flag knob on the previous build.
</li>
<li>
Inserts metadata into the stream in a more compliant manner. Direct matches to exif data go into the exif namespace, and the remainder into a new raw namespace.
</li>
<li>
Note that the defaults now use the camera metadata for white balance, as opposed to the DCRaw default illumination. Coupled with the change in knobs note that this makes this build incompatible with scripts saved from the previous build.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
J_rawReader: fixed bug when using a forced reader type (ie putting ’raw:’ at the start of the filename). This technique should now successfully work to force use of the rawReader when attempting to read in a file format for which no redirect has been included. Of course, if you find yourself often doing this, let me know on the nuke users list and I’ll add support natively.
</li>
<li>
J_MergeHDR: altered to set shutter speed from metadata as an expression, as opposed to evaluating the fraction. This allows you to hover over the relevant knob to show tooltip, or pop up the expression box, to see the fractional representation of the value (ie 1/20 as opposed to 0.05).
</li>

<li>
Changed installers to install into the new common location searched by Nuke6.1. You may need to remove older versions from your .nuke directory to enable the new builds to be picked up. Rejigged python support scripts appropriately.
</li>
<li>
J_Scopes: fixed issue with Vectorscope when viewer run in float or half float modes. It was leaving the gl buffer in a bad state, which could cause the VIEWER PROCESS to fail when being run on graphics hardware.
</li>
<li>
Added 64-bit OSX builds.

Feature release of J_Ops for Nuke6.0v1. Platforms: Windows XP32, Windows XP64, Centos4.5 32bit, Centos4.5 64bit, MacOSX 10.5 32bit. Date: 02/10.

<ul>

<li>
J_rawReader added. J_rawReader is a precompiled NDK plug-in based on the NDK crwReader example which uses DCRaw to read in a variety of SLR raw formats. J_rawReader adds, over the top of crwReader, controls to allow the user to tweak the flags passed to DCRaw (with control over the flags between full res and proxy mode), and it inserts metadata extracted from the raw file (again via DCRaw) into the stream. crwReader redirects from canon raw formats only (crw &amp; cr2). J_rawReader additionally redirects from Nikon (sorry, I said a bad word) raw formats and Adobe DNG.
</li>
<li>
Split menu.py into init.py for plugin path setup and menu.py for toolbars. As it should have been in the first place.

<li>
J_3Way added (hence renaming of bundle). J_3Way is a precompiled NDK plug-in providing gain/lift/gamma style colour grading functionality. It has on screen controls allowing grade creation whilst interacting directly on the image canvas in an artist friendly manner, and a gpu implementation for rapid feedback of results. It also implements a python based framework for importing and exporting ASC CDL data, allowing exchange with other packages. At this time CCC and CDL import has been implemented, and a framework provided for allowing extension to other file types. See the <a class="Reference" href="#sub:J_3Way">↓</a> J_3Way section for more information.

</div>
<ul>

<li>
Added a source region selector. This allows you to pick exactly what data the plugin is drawing scopes of. The options are: 
<ul>

<li>
Viewer - this matches what the plugin was previously doing. With ’Skip Lines’ set to none any lines being drawn by the viewer are drawn by the scopes. 
</li>
<li>
ROI - This draws every line (per the ’Skip Lines’ setting) of the region selected in the Viewer. The ROI defaults to the format of the clip initially plugged into it. 
</li>
<li>
Slice - This draws the scopes for the line specified by the two terminating points now drawn in the viewer. The X and Y Parade and Waveform tools will now draw the distance as against the length of the line in question, rather than against their respective axes, thus performing ’slicetool’ type functionality. 
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Set up core to use zero time close calls, making handle drawing on completion much more robust.

</div>
<ul>

<li>
Added full vectorscope graticle - amending major target box to +/- 7 degrees, and adding minor target box at +/- 2 degrees plus crosshair. Added labels for targets and axes. 
</li>
<li>
Recoded vectorscope data storage for lower memory overhead and greater speed. 
</li>
<li>
Added a knob to allow switching of maths used to calculate Y Cb Cr from RGB from ITU.BT-701 to ITU.BT601. This doesnt change the scope frameworks (ie graticles) however. Calculation has been shifted from scope classes to iop itself for additional speed when dealing with multiple scopes using YCbCr data. 
</li>
<li>
Lowered memory footprint of dispatching in some circumstances 
</li>
<li>
Add the following Parade and Waveform scopes, each of which is available in an X and Y variety - X maps against the horiztonal axis, Y against the vertical (note when using Y scopes you’ll probably want to set the skip lines to 1, otherwise you’re immediately chopping out lines of data). Each has a graticle of 5 lines, running from 0 (lowest, or most left) to 1 (highest, or most right), at 0.2 intensity increments. Note intensity is measured in the 0 to 1 range for visible data, rather than IRE scales. Out of range data is also plotted: 
<ul>

<li>
Y Waveform - plots luminance (calculated using the selected maths) against the X or Y axis. 
</li>
<li>
YC Waveform - plots luminance and chrominance against the X or Y axis. Y is calculated using the selected maths. C is a hypot of the selected CbCr maths, riding on the Y data. 
</li>
<li>
YCbCr Parade - plots the Y Cb and Cr signals alongside each other against the selected axis. Since Cb and Cr signals roam from +0.5 to -0.5 (when calculated from RGB data in the 0-1 range), both chrominance channels have their 0 point at 0.5 on the intensity axis. 
</li>
<li>
RGB Parade - plots the R, G and B signals alongside each other against the selected axis. -Rewrote plugin core to make begin and end frame calls robust. Moved forced refresh button to debug panel as a result of this.
</li>
